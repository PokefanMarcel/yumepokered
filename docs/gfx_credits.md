# Credits for graphics

- All sprites for the female player character from Madame Frog/Hatuntun (retrieved [here](https://www.deviantart.com/ghost-missingno/art/Blue-Sprites-for-R-G-B-Y-339796334)), as well as the high-res backsprite for the male character -- some with light modifications by me.
The high-res Old Man backsprite is from [PureRGB](https://github.com/Vortyne/pureRGB).

- All Yellow sprites have been adapted from ([LouLilie's](https://www.deviantart.com/loulilie/art/PokemonSpecial-Sprites-Yellow-302559354)).

- Gym leaders' overworld sprites were obtained from [Yellow Legacy](https://github.com/cRz-Shadows/Pokemon_Yellow_Legacy).

- Will's battle sprite was made by Corra (on the pokered discord).

- Pokémon CRYSTAL sprites are a mix of original sprites from Gold/Silver, and reworked sprites from [Polished Crystal](https://github.com/Rangi42/polishedcrystal).

- Some Pokémon BLUE backsprites have been reworked by me, sometimes with inspiration from [SkidMarc25's work](https://www.deviantart.com/skidmarc25/art/Pokemon-Red-Blue-Green-Yellow-Back-Sprite-Touchups-977256591).

- Custom tilesets were largely made by me. Exceptions include: a few Power Plant gfx (from the Spaceworld 97 demo), the lava graphics and animations (from [PureRGB](https://github.com/Vortyne/pureRGB)).

- I received additional help and feedback on some designs from people on the pokered discord, most notably Mauve and FrenchOrange.
